# Save Cleaner
### This attempts to fix saves broken by the removal of one or more of the following
- ships
- ship parts
- items
- islands
- sail colors

### Comes with a setting for automatic file overwrite (on by default)
- ON: fixes savedata on load and writes it back into the file on disk
- OFF: fixes savedata on load, but waits for the game to save normally

### Usage
- put SaveCleaner.dll in your plugins folder
- load the save you want to fix
- if overwrite is off, save and quit
- remove SaveCleaner.dll from your plugins folder
